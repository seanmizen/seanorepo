# CLAUDE.md

Sean's personal polyglot monorepo: Yarn 4 workspaces under `apps/*` and
`utils/*`. Node/React (RSBuild), Bun + Fastify backends, Go services, Zig. The
readme's philosophy applies: "this is mine, so I will commit wantonly".

More instructions load only when they are relevant:

- `.claude/rules/` - rules scoped to paths. They load when you touch matching
  files: Docker and ports, deployment, carolinemizen.art.
- `.claude/skills/workflow/` - the ticket, branch, PR and merge procedure. Use
  it whenever you create an issue or open a PR.
- A `CLAUDE.md` inside an app or util (`apps/inside`, `utils/swindowzig`,
  ...) loads when you work in that directory.

## Setup

```bash
corepack enable && corepack prepare && yarn
```

Root `package.json` scripts are the entry points (`yarn sean`, `yarn caroline`,
`yarn prod:docker`, `yarn release`, ...). Read them rather than guessing.

## Hard rules

- **Yarn 4 only.** Never `npm install` or `bun install`. Bun is a runtime only
  (`bun index.ts`). Bundling belongs to the build tool, never `bun build`.
- **Before you finish:** run `yarn fix` from the root (Biome: lint and format).
  Run `tsc --noEmit` in every TypeScript backend you touched. Fix every error.
- **Never `--no-verify`.** The hooks run commitlint.
- **Every published port names its host address:**
  `"${PUBLISH_ADDR:-127.0.0.1}:4000:4000"`. Never a bare `"4000:4000"`. See
  `.claude/rules/ports.md`.
- **Merging to `main` deploys nothing.** Production runs the `release` branch.
  `yarn release` fast-forwards it to `main`. Run it only when Sean asks.
- **All backend API routes use the `/api` prefix.**
- **Write in STE.** Load the `ste` skill (`.claude/skills/ste/`) before you
  write prose. Use Strict mode for error messages, tool descriptions and agent
  instructions. Use STE-flavored mode for docs, comments, commit messages, PR
  bodies and replies to Sean. Run `.claude/skills/ste/scripts/ste-lint.py` on
  new prose. In code comments and docs, cite the requirement (`REQ-DEPLOY-002`)
  and never the issue or PR number.

## Conventions

- Branch: `SEAN-{issue}/{short-description}`. Lowercase, hyphenated, at most 5
  words.
- Commit and PR title: `[SEAN-{issue}] {type}: {description}`. Types: `feat fix
  chore docs refactor test style perf ci`.
- One ticket = one branch = one PR, squash-merged. Out-of-scope work gets a new
  issue, not a commit on this branch.
- Work in a worktree, never on the `main` checkout.

Full procedure, with `gh` commands: `.claude/skills/workflow/SKILL.md`.

## Layout

- `apps/` - one directory per site or service. Frontend and backend share a
  `docker-compose.yml`, and backends sit beside their frontends.
- `utils/` - tooling. `utils/debbie/` provisions and deploys the home servers.
  `utils/fly-io/` is the Fly.io bundle.
- `scripts/` - repo-level scripts (`promote-release.sh`, `test-deployment.sh`).
- `requirements/` - the requirements index and its checker
  (`yarn requirements:check`).
